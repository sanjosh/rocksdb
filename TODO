Iterator

DONE
* fetch multiple from remote iterator 
* put tombstones for delete in repl_server 

TODO
* How to test for correctness of merge ??

* use min(memtable->earliest_seqno, snapshot_seqnum) 
  on remote as upper bound for scan
  
  assuming memtable->earliest_seqno < current seqnum

============================

TODO
replication should be per-CF not per-DB

============================

SST Files

TODO
* Check memtable not deleted before 
    remote seq > memtable.greatest_seqnum

DONE
* disable SST write during recovery and normal ops
  while still ensuring that Memtables get deleted

  made conditional invocations to 
  a) WriteLevel0Table
  b) WriteLevel0TableForRecovery

============================

Schema 

TODO
* create CF & delete CF need sequence number

============================

WAL update
* wait for ack in client-side rocksdb in flushReplLog
* have background thread which reads sockets & awakens
  waiting threads via callback/future

============================

RPC
* use apache thrift ?

============================
MySQL - myrocks changes
* separate column family

============================
Tests
* correctness tests
* performance tests
* mongo tests

============================
Operational issues
* Config, reuse current op tools
