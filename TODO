Iterator
* fetch multiple from remote iterator
* How to test for correctness of merge

* put tombstones for delete in repl_server
* use min(memtable->earliest_seqno, snapshot_seqnum) 
  on remote as upper bound for scan
  
  memtable->earliest_seqno -- current seqnum

============================

SST Files
* verify changes which disable SST write
  during recovery and normal ops

============================

Schema

============================

WAL update
* have one repl thread for all dbs
